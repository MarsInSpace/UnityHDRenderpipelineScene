# UnityHDRenderpipelineScene

Developed in a Unity and C# programming course within the BA Game Design I am doing.  
This Unity project is all about experimenting with the HD Renderpipeline as well as Shaders and Postprocessing to create an aesthetic and interesting looking scene.  
The assets are not mine but were provided by the Professor.

## Have a look!

This repository contains the entire Unity project, NOT the build.  
To play, run the Unity Editor and play inside it.
